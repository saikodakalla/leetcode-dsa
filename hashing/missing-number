class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums) # find the number of distinct numbers in the array nums
        for i in range(n + 1): # iterate through the amount of distinct numbers plus 1 to account for 0 
            if i not in nums: # if a value from 0 to # of distinct numbers is not in that array
                return i # return that value 
        
this solution is O(n^2), use the solution below for more optimal time complexity:

class Solution: 
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums) 
        seen = set(nums) # O(n) 
        for i in range(n + 1): # 0..n inclusive 
            if i not in seen: # O(1) average 
                return i
